# To Do

[ ] introduce colonies
[ ] use sprite batch to draw tiles
[ ] completed commands should be removed from queue
[ ] Android bug: for some reason tile IDs are not passed on to the map rendering function

# Done

[x] have commands calculate the proper number of required action points
[x] viewport should support a focus on event/method
[x] instead of subscribing Game, Viewport, etc directly to input events, there should be something in between that also checks what can be done at the current state of the game.
