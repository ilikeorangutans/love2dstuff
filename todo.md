# To Do

[ ] build colonies: should use all action points, settler gets "consumed" and added to colony
[ ] create function on map to get surroundings?
[ ] use sprite batch to draw tiles
[ ] Android bug: for some reason tile IDs are not passed on to the map rendering function

# Done

[x] completed commands should be removed from queue
[x] marker for worked fields
[x] terrain types
[x] introduce colonies
[x] have commands calculate the proper number of required action points
[x] viewport should support a focus on event/method
[x] instead of subscribing Game, Viewport, etc directly to input events, there should be something in between that also checks what can be done at the current state of the game.
