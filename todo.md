# To Do

[ ] viewport should support a focus on event/method
[ ] have commands calculate the proper number of required action points
[ ] completed commands should be removed from queue

# Done

[ ] instead of subscribing Game, Viewport, etc directly to input events, there should be something in between that also checks what can be done at the current state of the game.
